<ol><h1>Welcome to My World<hl><ol>

  
  <p> I am a 16 year old junior in highschool. I live in Philadelphia with my mother and my brother.
    I go to the City School which is a private christian school. I want to duel major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Spanish.
  I have always loved compiuters and coming to Tech It Out made me love it even more. I hope to come back next semester and be apart of this all over again.

  <p>  A few things about me are that:
    I enjoy eating and watching netflix, 
    I am a cheerleader and I am a tutor for math, and I hate being called short. </p>
