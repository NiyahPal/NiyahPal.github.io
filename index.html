<ol><h1>Welcome to My World<hl><ol>

  
  <p> My name is Niyah Palmer and I am a 18 year old Computer Science major at Howard University.
  I will be a freshman Fall 2018 and my anticipated graduation is 2018.
  I have always loved computers and coming to Tech It Out made me love it even more.
  I am glad to have the opportunity to come to Tech It Out Philly two years in a row.
